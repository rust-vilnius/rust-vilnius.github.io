## Install Rust

We recommend using [the Rustup installer](https://rustup.rs/).

Using the installer at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/downloads.html)
is fine too, but Rustup allows switching between stable/beta/nightly channels
easier, and integrates better with some editors.

## Set up your editor

Head to [https://areweideyet.com/](https://areweideyet.com/), pick your editor, and set up rust plugin
for it (if needed).

### Or use IntelliJ Community Edition

To make sure most of this goes smoothly, we recommend using IntelliJ editor
which does not depend on external tool `racer` for code completion.

[Set up instructions for IntelliJ are here](https://intellij-rust.github.io/docs/quick-start.html).
