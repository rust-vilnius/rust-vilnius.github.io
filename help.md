## Playground

[Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) is Rust snippet editor and compiler in the browser window, for testing ideas and sharing them.

## Quick learning resources

[Rust for C++ developers](https://github.com/nrc/r4cppp) is good if you understand memory management in C, and you understand modern C++.

[Rust by Example](http://rustbyexample.com/) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

[Intro to Ownership for C# developers](https://nblumhardt.com/2016/03/exploring-rust/) - a blog post that shows how Rust ownership can replace `using`.

[Rust Patterns](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/patterns) contains few idiomatic Rust examples.

[Rust for Closurists](https://gist.github.com/oakes/4af1023b6c5162c6f8f0).

[Rust for JavaScript developers](http://blog.thoughtram.io/rust/2015/05/11/rusts-ownership-model-for-javascript-developers.html) mostly discusses ownership and borrowing.

## Comprehensive guides

[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is suitable learning resource for anyone.

[New Rust Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/book/ch01-00-introduction.html) is in-progress rewrite of official Rust Book. It's not yet complete, but it is a better learning resource for things it already covers. For missing chapters, refer to Rust Book.

[Comparing Rust and Java](https://llogiq.github.io/2016/02/28/java-rust.html) is high level overview of differences between type system, flow, patterns, error handling, closures, metaprogramming.
